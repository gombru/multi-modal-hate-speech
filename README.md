Code of the publication "Exploring Hate Speech Detection in Multimodal Publications" accepted in WACV 2020.  
Check [the blog post](https://gombru.github.io/2019/10/09/MMHS/) for more information.  
To be released soon.  

Unfortunately I didn't have the time to clean and release this code. But given the interest shown, a messy version of the code can be found [here](https://github.com/gombru/HateSpeech). However, note that the interest of this research work is not the code and data modeling itself, but the dataset and the conclusions obtained in this very first approach to multi-modal hate speech detection. If you aim to reproduce the modeling explained in the paper, I suggest building on other and up to date classification projects which might address different tasks but present similar architectures.
I wish the community a successful journey on this research!
